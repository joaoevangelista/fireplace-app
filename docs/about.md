# About

The Fireplace project aims to bring a solution to parks and protected florets,
that centralize the reporting of incidents and fires around the limits, so the
past and present reports get accessible to anyone and they don't are lost, just
because they are small occurrences, with this we can target better preventions
and campaigns about the preservation of natural life.

It's easy deployed, so each park can have one instance, without depending in a
whole grid of systems.

And lastly but not least important, it's fully
[open source](https://gitlab.com/joaoevangelista/fireplace), that means that it
can be customized to attend each use case if needed, with no restriction.
